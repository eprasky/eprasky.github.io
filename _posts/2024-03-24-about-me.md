Hello! I'm **Evan G. Prasky**, a PhD student in Marine Ecology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. This website serves as a platform to share my research, publications, and professional activities.

### My Research Focus

I study human-wildlife conflicts in marine ecosystems, with a particular focus on depredationâ€”the phenomenon where predators consume hooked fish before anglers can land them. This research area provides unique insights into:

- How recreational anglers interact with aquatic predators
- The ecological and social dimensions of aquatic fisheries
- Policy implications for shark conservation and management
- Stakeholder engagement in aquatic resource management

### What You'll Find Here

- **About Me**: My background, research interests, and professional experience
- **Research**: Peer-reviewed publications and technical reports
- **Consulting**: Information about research collaboration and stakeholder engagement services
- **Contact**: Ways to get in touch for collaborations or discussions

### Current Work

I'm currently working on characterizing depredation within the Northeast U.S. Large Marine Ecosystem and understanding how anglers respond to these interactions. My research employs ethnographic methods to ensure that stakeholder perspectives are integrated into conservation and management decisions.

### Get in Touch

I'm always interested in discussing marine ecology, human-wildlife conflicts, and conservation.
