## Welcome to My Research Website

Hello! I'm **Evan G. Prasky**, a PhD student in Marine Ecology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. This website serves as a platform to share my research, publications, and professional activities.

### My Research Focus

I study **human-wildlife conflicts** in marine ecosystems, with a particular focus on **depredation** - the phenomenon where hooked fish are consumed by predators before anglers can land them. This research area provides unique insights into:

- How recreational anglers interact with marine predators
- The ecological and social dimensions of marine fisheries
- Policy implications for shark conservation and management
- Stakeholder engagement in marine resource management

### What You'll Find Here

- **About Me**: My background, research interests, and professional experience
- **Research**: Peer-reviewed publications and technical reports
- **Consulting**: Information about research collaboration and stakeholder engagement services
- **Contact**: Ways to get in touch for collaborations or discussions

### Current Work

I'm currently working on quantifying depredation patterns in Gulf of Mexico fisheries and understanding how anglers respond to these interactions. My research employs ethnographic methods to ensure that stakeholder perspectives are integrated into conservation and management decisions.

### Get in Touch

I'm always interested in discussing marine ecology, human-wildlife conflicts, and conservation. Whether you're a fellow researcher, stakeholder, or just curious about my work, feel free to reach out through the [contact page](/contact) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evan-prasky-815ab5108/).
