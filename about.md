## Evan G. Prasky

**PhD Student in Marine Ecology**  
*University of Massachusetts Amherst*

I am a PhD student at UMass Amherst studying marine ecology with a focus on human-wildlife conflicts and depredation in marine ecosystems. My research examines the complex interactions between recreational anglers and marine predators, particularly sharks, in the Gulf of Mexico.

### Research Focus

My work centers on **depredation** - the phenomenon where hooked fish are partially or wholly consumed by predators before being landed by anglers. This provides a unique lens through which to study:

- Angler perceptions and responses to marine predators
- Human-wildlife conflict dynamics in marine environments
- Policy implications for coastal shark management and conservation
- Socio-ecological systems in marine fisheries

### Background

I received my **Master's degree in Marine and Environmental Science** from Northeastern University in 2023, where my thesis focused on assessing shark depredation in the Gulf of Mexico. My research employs ethnographic approaches to understand angler perceptions and the complexities of marine ecosystems.

### Professional Experience

- **Army Veteran** - Bringing discipline and leadership experience to academic research
- **Avid Fisherman** - Personal experience that informs my understanding of angler perspectives
- **Beginner Fly Fisherman** - Continuously learning and expanding my knowledge of fishing techniques

### Research Approach

I specialize in using **ethnographic methods** to understand stakeholder perspectives and co-produce knowledge about complex socio-ecological systems. My work bridges the gap between scientific research and stakeholder engagement, ensuring that management decisions are informed by both ecological data and human dimensions.

### Current Projects

- Quantifying depredation rates and patterns in Gulf of Mexico fisheries
- Understanding angler responses to depredation events
- Developing stakeholder engagement frameworks for marine conservation
- Assessing the effectiveness of shark management policies
