**Evan G. Prasky** is a Ph.D. student at UMass Amherst. Evan's work looks to quantify and understand depredation in marine and aquatic ecosystems. Dep·re·da·tion is, in an ecological context, when a hooked fish is partially or wholly consumed before it is landed. Depredation provides unique opportunities to study angler interactions with their ecosystem and how they respond to policy changes. Evan got his Master's degree in Marine and Environmental Science from Northeastern University in 2023. His thesis was focused on assessing shark depredation in the Gulf of Mexico. Evan specializes in using an ethnographic approach to understand angler perceptions and the complexities of their ecosystems. He is also an Army Veteran, avid fisherman, and beginner fly fisherman.
