**Evan G. Prasky** As a Ph.D. student at UMass Amherst, Evan's work looks to quantify and understand depredation in marine and aquatic ecosystems. Dep·re·da·tion is the act of attacking or plundering; in an ecological context, it is when a hooked fish is partially or wholly consumed while in the process of landing. Depredation provides unique opportunities to study how anglers interact with their ecosystem and how they respond to policy changes. Evan Got his Master's from Northeastern University in 2023, and his thesis was focused on assessing shark depredation in the Gulf of Mexico. He specializes in using an ethnographic approach to understand anglers' complexities with their ecosystems. He is also an Army Veteran, avid fisherman, and beginner fly fisherman.
