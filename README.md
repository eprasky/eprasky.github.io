## Research Focus

My work centers on **depredation** - the phenomenon where hooked fish are consumed by predators before anglers can land them. This research provides insights into:

- Human-wildlife conflict dynamics in marine environments
- Angler perceptions and responses to marine predators

- Stakeholder engagement in marine resource management
